  <p>To prepare, start by cooking ground beef and Italian sausage in a large skillet until browned. Add finely chopped onions, garlic, and a blend of crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce. Season with salt, pepper, basil, oregano, and a touch of sugar, then simmer the sauce for at least 30 minutes to develop deep flavors. While the sauce is simmering, prepare the béchamel by melting butter in a saucepan, stirring in flour to form a roux, and slowly whisking in milk until thickened. Season with a pinch of nutmeg, salt, and pepper.</p>
  <p>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Place a layer of cooked lasagna noodles over the sauce, followed by a generous spread of béchamel, a sprinkle of shredded mozzarella, and a handful of grated Parmesan cheese. Repeat these layers, finishing with a top layer of meat sauce and a final sprinkling of mozzarella and Parmesan. Cover with foil and bake in a preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly. Allow the lasagna to rest for 15 minutes before serving to ensure perfect slices.
